### HTML - disabled buttons

#### HTML protection ? huh make sense. 

As we can see there is nothing rather than spawn machine and a statement ***This form is disabled and can not be used. Itâ€™s up to you to find a way to use it.***.
I just spawn the chall, and got interface like below:

And checked from the browser dev tool. As you can in the attached screnshot, there is `input` with value `disabled`. What if I change it to enabled ?? Let's see:

Now , I can submit member access, I put `anything` there and I got the password.
