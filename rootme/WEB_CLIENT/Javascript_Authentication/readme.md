### Javascript - Authentication
The challenge seems like authentication bypass or something like this. I have stated the chall and it bring me to login page.

I tried login using default password and username like `admin` & `admin` OR `admin` & `pass` but didn't work. 

After that I continue to look over source code. There I can find a JS script called `login.js`, in which we got our creds.

I submitted the password as password, and yahu it got solved.


#### lesson learned, 
> Always read source code, alware inspect even if its a 404 page : )
