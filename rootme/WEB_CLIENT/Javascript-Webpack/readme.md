## Javascript - Webpack

AS the name suggests, I just started to look over the source codes like js and css and Under the file `app.a92c5074dafac0cb6365.js` I got a commented `.map` file. I just downloaded it and searched for `flag` string and got the password. 

I took literally more than a hour to solve it, I went to the file first but I didn't searched for string `flag` but instead `password` and so much more. The recon is too much deeper than the solution.
