# API - Broken Access

## Statement
Your friend has set up a platform where you can register and post a private note. Everything is based on an API. Before setting up the Front-End, he asked you to check that everything was secure.

When we visit the target url, we got a simple API in which we can basically `signup/login/make notes/search for user`.

Loggin as normal user & Intercepting every request

`/api/user` seems vulnerable as we can search for user and its notes.

Tried Broken Access by changing user_id to `1`.

Yup, that was this much.
