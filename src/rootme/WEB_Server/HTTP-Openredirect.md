## HTTP - Open redirect
We got a simple website where we can simply go to facebook, twitter or so on. The challenge is to make the website redirect to any other website rather than the given option.

As usual, I started to check the `source code` and just look for `request` and `response` over BURP

Let's make some changes over the request and try to redirect to `evil.com` instead.

Well, interesting,the redirection is primarily checking for the hash and if its incorrect, the redirection gets failed. These are the hash and its respective site for the redirection.

Looks like `MD5` but let's check it from https://hashes.com/en/tools/hash_identifier

I got the logic. Let's reverse it

Okay, everything crystle clear. 
```bash
echo -n "https://evil.com" | md5sum
-> 7a1eb5272a0de83226e7a50d14334056
```
Wallah, we got the flag.
