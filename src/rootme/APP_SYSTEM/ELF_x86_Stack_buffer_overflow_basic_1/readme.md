### ELF x86 - Stack buffer overflow basic 1

Here is the `C` code which is given in the chall. 

<details>
<summary>C code</summary>
  
```c
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
 
int main()
{
 
  int var;
  int check = 0x04030201;
  char buf[40];
 
  fgets(buf,45,stdin);
 
  printf("\n[buf]: %s\n", buf);
  printf("[check] %p\n", check);
 
  if ((check != 0x04030201) && (check != 0xdeadbeef))
    printf ("\nYou are on the right way!\n");
 
  if (check == 0xdeadbeef)
   {
     printf("Yeah dude! You win!\nOpening your shell...\n");
     setreuid(geteuid(), geteuid());
     system("/bin/bash");
     printf("Shell closed! Bye.\n");
   }
   return 0;
}
```

Let's access the server via `ssh`. and try to solve the chall.

```bash

ssh -p 2222 app-systeme-ch13@challenge02.root-me.org
```

Here, we have some files which got my attention.

We have a `.passwd` file, and it seems like there we can get the flag for the chall. Unfortunately. we cann't access the file, as we don't have access for it.

Now, let's dive into the vulnerable code and spawn the shell,

We have `char buf[40];` buffer set but the program allows `fgets(buf, 45, stdin);` 45 long buffer. So, my metholodogy will be
1. The `check` variable is stored right after the buffer in memory.
2. By overflowing the buffer, we can overwrite `check`.
3. We need to change `check` to `0xdeadbeef`.

Let's quickly check for the binary protections and jump right into it.

hmm. looks simple. 

Here I'm giving the exact 40 long buffer and see what it return.

Well, as expected, providing extra 4 bytes (`\xef\xbe\xad\xde`) to overflow into check and we can now overwrite it with `0xdeadbeef`.
```c
if ((check != 0x04030201) && (check != 0xdeadbeef))
    printf ("\nYou are on the right way!\n");

if (check == 0xdeadbeef)
```

It closed the shell immediatly, Let's try run `cat` to keep `stdin` open.

Wallah, we got the shell.
